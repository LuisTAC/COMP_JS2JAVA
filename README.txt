** SUMMARY: The framework developed allows the user to parse a JavaScript code snippet through JSON objects created using Esprima (http://esprima.org/demo/parse.html), 
analysing it's systax using ANTLR (Another Tool for Language Recognition).

**DEALING WITH SYNTACTIC ERRORS: The framework does not recover from syntactic errors, exiting right away.

**SEMANTIC ANALYSIS:

**INTERMEDIATE REPRESENTATIONS (IRs): The frameworks walks the tree once to determine class scopes, methods and variable definitions so that it is possible to infer semantic 
errors when the framework generates the code;

**CODE GENERATION: After defining the intermediate representation, the code generation tool analysis the tokens used in each rule processed inside the ParseTree walker, saving the 
content of the code generated into a stack of strings.

**OVERVIEW: As stated before, the framework starts by making the syntactic analysis of the input JSON file generated by Esprima exiting in case it finds any error. Once the 
JSON is validated by ANTLR, the framework walks the tree once to determine class scopes, methods and variable definitions. After building the intermediate representation, the ParseTree
is walked once again validating possible sematinc errors and generating the code in case of success.

**TESTSUITE AND TEST INFRASTRUCTURE: 

Example1 - Valid example, includes global variables, functions, for and while statements, if statements and return statements;
Example2 - Invalid example, binary expression invalid for j%2 (j = String); 
Example3 - Invalid example, a is neither declared or defined;
Example4 - Invalid example, array and a are neither declared or defined;
Example5 - Invalid example, invalid push of String into array of int;

**TASK DISTRIBUTION: (Identify the set of tasks done by each member of the project.)

**PROS: é proibido.

**CONS: mas pode-se fazer.
