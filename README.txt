**SUMMARY: The framework developed allows the user to parse a JavaScript code snippet through JSON objects created using Esprima (http://esprima.org/demo/parse.html), analysing it's systax using ANTLR (Another Tool for Language Recognition).

**DEALING WITH SYNTACTIC ERRORS: The framework does not recover from syntactic errors, exiting right away.

**SEMANTIC ANALYSIS: : The framework does not check for semantic errors.

**INTERMEDIATE REPRESENTATIONS (IRs): The initial idea was to make the framework walk the tree once to determine class scopes, methods and variable definitions so that it is possible to infer semantic errors when the framework generates the code; however, the idea was not fully implemented and the intermediate representation is not used.

**CODE GENERATION: The code generation tool analysis the tokens used in each rule processed inside the ParseTree walker, saving the content of the code generated into a stack of strings.

**OVERVIEW: As stated before, the framework starts by making the syntactic analysis of the input JSON file generated by Esprima exiting in case it finds any error. Once the JSON is validated by ANTLR, the framework walks the tree generating the code in case of success.

**TESTSUITE AND TEST INFRASTRUCTURE: 

Example1 - Valid example, includes global variables, functions, for and while statements, if statements and return statements;
Example2 - Invalid example, binary expression invalid for j%2 (j = String); 
Example3 - Invalid example, a is neither declared or defined;
Example4 - Invalid example, array and a are neither declared or defined;
Example5 - Invalid example, invalid push of String into array of int;

**TASK DISTRIBUTION: Every member of the group participated in each part of the project.

**PROS: The grammar only allows JSON objects valid for the Esprima parser.

**CONS: Semantic analysis (due to intermediate representation incompleteness).
